            <p>
              What i would like to achieve for this project is to make a product
              that speaks to using alternative control schemes as a way to
              create music with friends without the traditional means of
              analogue instruments and midi. Instead the device itself (mobile
              phone) and an online connection to this site will act as a pc
              without the need of central pc. Therefore, users will have to be
              connected to the website on their phones in order to use the
              features of the app. This is because the project uses api's,
              namely the Accelerometer and Web Audio Api to achieve my goals.
              Api's are interfaces that offer a service to other pieces of
              software, which in this case would be javascript. Therefore, by
              using javascript and these services together (both of which are
              native to web programming) it has allowed me to make the above
              prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              The kind of auditory art that i seek to create with this project is synonymous
              the performance art aspect of music. So, the kind would include users
              casually jamming out together creating patterns and beats with the application
